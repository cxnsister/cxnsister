👋 Hi, I’m Ravikumar @cxnsister
👀 I’m interested in creating scalable cloud solutions using AWS technologies like VPC, Lambda, Step functions and Amazon MQ. I'm also keen on optimizing performance in distributed systems and databases, particularly MongoDB Atlas.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about serverless architectures and exploring new AWS services that enhance application performance.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require innovative cloud-based solutions and efficient data handling strategies.
